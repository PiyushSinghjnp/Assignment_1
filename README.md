PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a simple e-commerce product display app that uses the DummyJSON API to fetch and display products. The app allows users to:

View all product categories.
Select a category and display products related to that category.
Search for products within the selected category or across all categories.
Fetch products in batches of 10 using a pagination mechanism without traditional UI pagination.
The app is built using React.js, with Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
